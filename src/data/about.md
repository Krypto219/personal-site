# Intro

I am a CTO of [Arthena](https://arthena.com) where I build tools to price fine art quickly, accurately, and at scale. I also advise startups, and I invest in people and ideas through a [small venture fund](https://skepticalinvestments.biz). I am particularly interested in projects that touch health and safety, imaging, social impact, and aerospace. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At Arthena, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). I primarily work as a data engineer but have broad experience across Arthenaâ€™s stack.
